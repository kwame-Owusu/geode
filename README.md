## Why?

**Geode** is a free [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin that syncs your vault across multiple
devices (including iOS) through storage that you own, and encrypted before anything leaves your
device.

Our aim is to build the best remote sync plugin available for Obsidian users; Apple Notes is the
quality bar, something that just always works and you don't even think about.

Whilst also offering a remote MCP server and API to your vault, so that any agent (e.g. Claude,
Codex) can read/write to the same vault, using it as memory. As we believe the full power of
Obsidian is unlocked via agents.

**TL;DR** → Remote sync, using storage you own, encrypted, with MCP/API for your agents to use
Obsidian as memory.
