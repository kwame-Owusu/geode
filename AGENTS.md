# AGENTS.md

## Context

- [Obsidian Developer Documentation](https://docs.obsidian.md) on building plugins and themes

## Product Vision

- Your notes stay yours: plain files, synced through storage you control, encrypted before they
  leave your device; no lock in, nothing held hostage, walk away any time
- Your vault becomes reachable by the agents and tools you trust, from anywhere, without a laptop
  awake; Geode makes the vault a first class citizen of the agent era
- Sync you never think about: quiet, boring, trustworthy; silence means everything is fine, and no
  edit is ever silently lost
- One system, one bucket: sync, MCP, and the API all read the same storage and the same long term
  format, so every device and every agent sees the same vault
- Free where it matters: the plugin and sync stay free for the community; convenience is what's
  paid (managed storage, hosted MCP and API)
- The test for every decision: would we point it at our own vault, and would we hand the keys to
  no one

## Documentation

Ensure that documentation is added to, and updated, as the project progresses; as well as continue
to update the private
[Working Document](https://claude.ai/code/artifact/fa8682d6-0677-4d6c-a32d-c91e51411d8f) artifact as
we make decisions together about the project, and to track progress.

## Competitors

Risk is out of 5. Activity last checked 2026-07.

- [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync) → risk 5/5 → first party, E2E encrypted, excellent on
  mobile, very much alive; the existential scenario is Obsidian shipping an official API/MCP on
  top of it
- [Remotely Save](https://github.com/remotely-save/remotely-save) → risk 2/5 → 7.8k stars but no
  push since Nov 2024 and 215 open issues; the leading BYO storage sync plugin is effectively
  unmaintained, and its users are our first audience
- [Self-hosted LiveSync](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync) → risk 3/5 → 11.5k stars and
  very active; real time CouchDB sync for self hosters, same job, more demanding setup
- Folder syncers ([obsidian-git](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git) 11.5k stars and very
  active, iCloud, Syncthing) → risk 2/5 → free and good enough for simple setups; they cap the
  sync market, not the agent access market
- [Local REST API](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api) → risk 2/5 → 2.6k
  stars, active, ships a built-in MCP server; strong locally but requires Obsidian running on an
  awake machine
- Remote MCP via tunnels and hosted connectors
  ([obsidian-web-mcp](https://github.com/jimprosser/obsidian-web-mcp), 146 stars and young, and
  [MCPBundles](https://www.mcpbundles.com)) → risk 4/5 → early movers on our paid layer; all still
  need a live device or a tunnel to the vault, whereas Geode reads from storage with nothing awake
- Desktop agents reading vault files directly (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, etc) → risk 4/5 → the
  good enough default whenever the laptop is on; always on access is the differentiation to
  protect
- Hosted PKM with native AI ([Notion](https://notion.com), [Anytype](https://anytype.io),
  [Capacities](https://capacities.io)) → risk 3/5 → the long game threat is users leaving Obsidian
  entirely, not picking a rival plugin

## Remember

- Less is always more, simple is always better, boring is best, to avoid the magic!
- Whilst still meeting requirements, being secure, and delivering value for our users

## Development

- Line length is set to 100 characters for all project files

## Code Style

Write TypeScript as if it were Go: simple, explicit, boring. When unsure, ask what the dullest Go
programmer would do.

- The formatter is law; Biome decides and nobody debates the output
- Pure functions first; classes only where the Obsidian API demands them (`Plugin`,
  `PluginSettingTab`), and those classes are shells: methods delegate immediately to module level
  functions, no logic lives on the class
- Named exports only, except the plugin class Obsidian requires as a default export
- String literal unions over enums; `erasableSyntaxOnly` in tsconfig enforces strippable syntax
- `type` over `interface`: data shapes are structs, not contracts, and `type` can't be reopened
  by declaration merging; `interface` only if implementing a framework contract demands it
- Errors are values: domain logic returns results rather than throwing; exceptions stay at the
  framework boundary
- Explicit zero values: every type has a complete default (see `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`), never
  undefined shaped holes
- Guard clauses and early returns; flat beats nested; no `else` after a `return`
- No ternary expressions; Go doesn't have one and neither do we, write the `if` (file local
  helpers like `stringOr(v, fallback)` cover the defaulting cases)
- Braces on every `if`, even a one line body; Go's formatter won't let you drop them and neither
  do we
- Every exported symbol gets a one sentence `//` doc comment above it, Go style
  ("normalizeSettings returns..."); no JSDoc `/** */` blocks
- Table driven tests with `node:test` and `node:assert/strict`; no test framework dependencies
- Small files with one concern; no barrel files, no `utils.ts` dumping ground
- File names are kebab-case (`settings-tab.ts`); tests sit beside the code they test as
  `name.test.ts`, Go's `_test.go` pattern; graduate to package folders (`settings/tab.ts`) only
  when a concern outgrows single files
- Framework code stays thin glue; logic lives in pure modules that never import `obsidian`
- No clever generics, no decorators, no magic
- A small, focused dependency beats hand rolling something fiddly to get right (request signing,
  a mock server); it loses to hand rolling the moment it drags in a framework or an SDK we don't
  need

## Priorities

- When stuck, the blocker is usually priorities, not missing information → Decide and move
- One thing done exceptionally beats five things done adequately → Depth over breadth
- Not every rough edge needs fixing now → Some fires are allowed to burn; triage ruthlessly
- Users want value per second, not seconds of value → Optimize for speed and density, not features
