# AGENTS.md

## Context

- [Obsidian Developer Documentation](https://docs.obsidian.md) on building plugins and themes

## Product Vision

- Your notes stay yours: plain files, synced through storage you control, encrypted before they
  leave your device; no lock in, nothing held hostage, walk away any time
- Your vault becomes reachable by the agents and tools you trust, from anywhere, without a laptop
  awake; Geode makes the vault a first class citizen of the agent era
- Sync you never think about: quiet, boring, trustworthy; silence means everything is fine, and no
  edit is ever silently lost
- One system, one bucket: sync, MCP, and the API all read the same storage and the same long term
  format, so every device and every agent sees the same vault
- Free where it matters: the plugin and sync stay free for the community; convenience is what's
  paid (managed storage, hosted MCP and API)
- The test for every decision: would we point it at our own vault, and would we hand the keys to
  no one

## Documentation

Ensure that documentation is added to, and updated, as the project progresses; as well as continue
to update the private
[Working Document](https://claude.ai/code/artifact/fa8682d6-0677-4d6c-a32d-c91e51411d8f) artifact as
we make decisions together about the project, and to track progress.

## Similar Projects

- [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync) (Risk 5/5) → First party, E2E encrypted, excellent on
  mobile, very much alive; the existential scenario is Obsidian shipping an official API/MCP on top
  of it
- [Remotely Save](https://github.com/remotely-save/remotely-save) (Risk 2/5) → 7.8k stars but no
  push since Nov 2024 and 215 open issues; the leading BYO storage sync plugin is effectively
  unmaintained, and its users are our first audience
- [Self-hosted LiveSync](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync) (Risk 3/5) → 11.5k stars and
  very active; real time CouchDB sync for self hosters, same job, more demanding setup
- [obsidian-git](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git) (Risk 2/5) → 11.5k stars and very active
- [Local REST API](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api) (Risk 2/5) → 2.6k
  stars, active, ships a built-in MCP server; strong locally but requires Obsidian running on an
  awake machine
- Remote MCP via tunnels and hosted connectors
  ([obsidian-web-mcp](https://github.com/jimprosser/obsidian-web-mcp), 146 stars and young, and
  [MCPBundles](https://www.mcpbundles.com)) (Risk 4/5) → Early movers on our paid layer; all still
  need a live device or a tunnel to the vault, whereas Geode reads from storage with nothing awake
- Desktop agents reading vault files directly (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, etc) (Risk 4/5) → The
  good enough default whenever the laptop is on; always on access is the differentiation to protect
- Hosted PKM with native AI ([Notion](https://notion.com), [Anytype](https://anytype.io),
  [Capacities](https://capacities.io)) (Risk 3/5) → The long game threat is users leaving Obsidian
  entirely, not picking a rival plugin

## Remember

- Less is always more, simple is always better, boring is best, to avoid the magic!
- Whilst still meeting requirements, being secure, and delivering value for our users

## Code Style

It is critically important that you abide by all the rules set out in the `typescript-as-go` skill
(`.agents/skills/typescript-as-go/SKILL.md`) when writing TypeScript, no exceptions.

Additional rules for the project:

1. Line length is set to 100 characters for all project files
2. Classes only where the Obsidian API demands them (`Plugin`, `PluginSettingTab`), and those
   classes are shells: methods delegate immediately to module level functions, no logic lives on the
   class; the plugin class is the one default export Obsidian requires
3. Framework code stays thin glue; logic lives in pure modules that never import `obsidian`
4. `erasableSyntaxOnly` in tsconfig enforces strippable syntax
